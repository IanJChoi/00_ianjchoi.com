This repository documents what I learned in Advanced Systems Programming (Spring 2026), taught by Prof. Jae Lee.
website: https://cs4157.github.io/www/2026-1/

The course focused on low-level systems programming in C and UNIX/Linux environments, emphasizing how software interacts with the operating system and hardware.

Topics:
 - Memory allocators, caching, and memory-mapped files
 - Process lifecycle and signal handling
 - File I/O and non-blocking I/O models
 - Multithreading and synchronization primitives
 - Inter-process communication mechanisms
 - x86-64 assembly and system execution flow
 - ELF format, linking, and runtime loading
 - UNIX file systems and Linux containers
