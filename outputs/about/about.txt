Hi, I’m Ian J. Choi.
I’m a senior at Columbia University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.

As a career, I’m deeply interested in low-level computing, particularly operating systems and systems programming. I’m fascinated by how software interacts with hardware — how memory is allocated and accessed, how processes are scheduled, how I/O flows through the system, and where latency actually emerges. Rather than treating these as abstract concepts, I enjoy breaking them down through hands-on exploration — building allocators, benchmarking cache behavior, and studying performance at the level of memory access patterns and system calls. I’m actively developing projects in this space to better understand the tradeoffs that shape real-world system performance.

Before computers, there was swimming.
I’ve been swimming since I was 4, competed as a member of the South Korean national team, and later swam for a Division I team in college. These days, swimming is more of a passion than a profession, and I spend most of my training time on CrossFit and HYROX — still chasing performance, just in different arenas.

I like building things, pushing limits, and staying curious — whether that’s in code, systems, or sport.
