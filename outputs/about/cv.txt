RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
--------------------------------
Allocator Simulator — Heap Memory Systems Study
Jan 2026 | github.com/IanJChoi/01_allocator_sim
• Built a pedagogical heap allocator to bridge theoretical memory management concepts with concrete virtual memory behavior.
• Implemented an implicit free-list design following CS:APP allocator architecture.
• Engineered boundary-tag metadata structures to track allocation status and block size.
• Simulated program break expansion and heap extension in page-sized increments.
• Produced detailed heap visualizations exposing allocation overhead and fragmentation dynamics.
• Investigated allocator invariants and edge cases through controlled malloc/free sequences.

Multi-Level Cache Locality & Memory Access Benchmarking
Feb 2026 | github.com/IanJChoi/02_cache_locality_benchmark
• Engineered low-level C benchmarks to probe L1/L2/L3 cache latency and bandwidth characteristics.
• Evaluated sequential, random, and chunked memory access patterns.
• Quantified cache-miss penalties and throughput collapse beyond cache residency thresholds.
• Studied cache-line fetching behavior and hardware prefetcher interactions.
• Analyzed memory hierarchy bottlenecks affecting systems and AI inference workloads.
• Produced performance visualizations correlating access stride with latency scaling.
